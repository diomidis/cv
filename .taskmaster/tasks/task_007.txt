# Task ID: 7
# Title: Develop Job Application Tailoring System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3, 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a system to customize CV content based on company research from the Job Opportunities folder.
# Details:
This task involves:
1. Implement company research extraction from Job Opportunities folder
2. Create keyword and skill matching between job requirements and CV content
3. Develop content prioritization based on job relevance
4. Build CV customization logic for specific applications
5. Implement version management for tailored CVs

Implementation approach:
```python
class JobApplicationTailor:
    def __init__(self, obsidian_reader, latex_processor, content_mapper):
        self.obsidian_reader = obsidian_reader
        self.latex_processor = latex_processor
        self.content_mapper = content_mapper
    
    def extract_company_research(self, company_name):
        # Look for company research in Job Opportunities folder
        company_path = f"Job Opportunities/{company_name}.md"
        try:
            research = self.obsidian_reader.read_file(company_path)
            return self.parse_company_research(research)
        except FileNotFoundError:
            return None
    
    def parse_company_research(self, research_content):
        # Extract key information from company research
        parsed = {
            'keywords': self.extract_keywords(research_content),
            'required_skills': self.extract_skills(research_content),
            'company_values': self.extract_values(research_content),
            'job_description': self.extract_job_description(research_content)
        }
        return parsed
    
    def extract_keywords(self, content):
        # Extract keywords from research content
        # Use regex or NLP techniques
        pass
    
    def extract_skills(self, content):
        # Extract required skills from research content
        pass
    
    def extract_values(self, content):
        # Extract company values from research content
        pass
    
    def extract_job_description(self, content):
        # Extract job description from research content
        pass
    
    def tailor_cv_for_company(self, company_name):
        research = self.extract_company_research(company_name)
        if not research:
            raise ValueError(f"No research found for {company_name}")
        
        # Create a copy of the CV for customization
        tailored_cv_path = f"{self.latex_processor.cv_path.replace('.tex', '')}_{company_name}.tex"
        shutil.copy(self.latex_processor.cv_path, tailored_cv_path)
        tailored_processor = LaTeXCVProcessor(tailored_cv_path)
        
        # Customize sections based on company research
        self.prioritize_experience(tailored_processor, research)
        self.highlight_relevant_skills(tailored_processor, research)
        self.customize_summary(tailored_processor, research)
        
        # Compile tailored CV
        tailored_processor.compile_pdf()
        
        return tailored_cv_path
    
    def prioritize_experience(self, cv_processor, research):
        # Reorder or emphasize experience items based on relevance
        pass
    
    def highlight_relevant_skills(self, cv_processor, research):
        # Emphasize skills that match job requirements
        pass
    
    def customize_summary(self, cv_processor, research):
        # Tailor professional summary to company values and job description
        pass
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for company research extraction with sample files
2. Test keyword and skill extraction with various research formats
3. Verify CV customization with different company profiles
4. Test prioritization logic with various experience entries
5. Validate PDF output for tailored CVs
6. Integration tests with actual company research documents
