# Task ID: 9
# Title: Develop Career Progress Tracking
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 5, 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a system to track career development milestones and automatically update CV content based on progress.
# Details:
This task involves:
1. Implement career plan extraction from Career Path-Industry Wiki
2. Create milestone tracking and achievement recognition
3. Develop automatic CV updates based on career progress
4. Build timeline visualization for career development
5. Implement goal tracking and alignment with CV content

Implementation approach:
```python
class CareerProgressTracker:
    def __init__(self, obsidian_reader, content_mapper, latex_processor):
        self.obsidian_reader = obsidian_reader
        self.content_mapper = content_mapper
        self.latex_processor = latex_processor
    
    def extract_career_plans(self):
        # Access career planning documents
        base_path = "Career Path-Industry Wiki/Career Plan (6m, 1y, 2y, 5y)"
        plans = {}
        
        for timeframe in ['6m', '1y', '2y', '5y']:
            try:
                plan_path = f"{base_path}/{timeframe}_plan.md"
                content = self.obsidian_reader.read_file(plan_path)
                plans[timeframe] = self.parse_career_plan(content)
            except FileNotFoundError:
                plans[timeframe] = None
        
        return plans
    
    def parse_career_plan(self, content):
        # Extract structured information from career plan
        parsed = {
            'goals': self.extract_goals(content),
            'milestones': self.extract_milestones(content),
            'skills': self.extract_target_skills(content)
        }
        return parsed
    
    def extract_goals(self, content):
        # Extract career goals from plan
        pass
    
    def extract_milestones(self, content):
        # Extract career milestones from plan
        pass
    
    def extract_target_skills(self, content):
        # Extract target skills to develop
        pass
    
    def identify_completed_milestones(self):
        # Compare career plans with current CV content
        # Identify which milestones have been completed
        plans = self.extract_career_plans()
        cv_content = self.latex_processor.get_all_sections()
        
        completed = []
        for timeframe, plan in plans.items():
            if not plan:
                continue
                
            for milestone in plan['milestones']:
                if self.is_milestone_completed(milestone, cv_content):
                    completed.append({
                        'timeframe': timeframe,
                        'milestone': milestone
                    })
        
        return completed
    
    def is_milestone_completed(self, milestone, cv_content):
        # Check if milestone is reflected in CV content
        pass
    
    def update_cv_with_progress(self):
        # Update CV based on career progress
        completed_milestones = self.identify_completed_milestones()
        
        # Update relevant CV sections
        for milestone in completed_milestones:
            # Determine which CV section to update
            # Apply updates
            pass
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for career plan extraction with sample files
2. Test milestone identification with various plan formats
3. Verify completed milestone detection with sample CV content
4. Test CV updates based on career progress
5. Validate timeline visualization accuracy
6. Integration tests with actual career planning documents
