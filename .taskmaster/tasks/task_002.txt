# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement Obsidian File Reader
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop a module to securely read and parse markdown files from the Obsidian career vault.
# Details:
This task involves:
1. Create a file system access module with proper error handling
2. Implement markdown parsing functionality to extract structured content
3. Build content categorization based on file location and structure
4. Develop a caching mechanism to optimize repeated access
5. Implement change detection to identify updates in Obsidian files

Implementation approach:
```python
class ObsidianReader:
    def __init__(self, base_path):
        self.base_path = base_path
        self.file_cache = {}
        self.last_modified = {}
    
    def read_file(self, relative_path):
        full_path = os.path.join(self.base_path, relative_path)
        if not os.path.exists(full_path):
            raise FileNotFoundError(f"File not found: {full_path}")
            
        # Check if file has been modified since last read
        mod_time = os.path.getmtime(full_path)
        if full_path in self.file_cache and self.last_modified.get(full_path) == mod_time:
            return self.file_cache[full_path]
            
        with open(full_path, 'r') as file:
            content = file.read()
            parsed_content = self.parse_markdown(content)
            self.file_cache[full_path] = parsed_content
            self.last_modified[full_path] = mod_time
            return parsed_content
    
    def parse_markdown(self, content):
        # Use a markdown parser to extract structured content
        # Return organized data structure with headers, lists, etc.
        pass
        
    def detect_changes(self, relative_path):
        # Check if file has been modified since last read
        # Return True if changes detected
        pass
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for file reading with various markdown formats
2. Test error handling with missing or inaccessible files
3. Verify parsing correctly extracts headers, lists, and formatted content
4. Performance testing with large markdown files
5. Test change detection with modified files
6. Integration tests with sample Obsidian vault structure
