# Task ID: 1
# Title: Analyze Existing System Structure
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Document and map the structure of the Obsidian career vault and LaTeX CV repository to understand the integration points.
# Details:
This task involves:
1. Analyze the Obsidian vault structure focusing on the specified paths:
   - Goals/Career/Career Strategy & Planning Hub
   - Goals/Career/Career Path-Industry Wiki/Career Plan (6m, 1y, 2y, 5y)/
   - Goals/Career/Job Opportunities/
   - Goals/Career/Interviews/
   - Goals/Career/CV/CV Strategy & Content.md
2. Parse and document the structure of cv_1023.tex to identify sections that will need updating
3. Create a mapping document that connects Obsidian content to CV sections
4. Identify file formats, content patterns, and key information in both systems
5. Document Git repository structure and workflow requirements

Implementation approach:
```python
def analyze_obsidian_structure(base_path):
    structure = {}
    for folder in ['Career Strategy & Planning Hub', 'Career Path-Industry Wiki/Career Plan (6m, 1y, 2y, 5y)', 
                  'Job Opportunities', 'Interviews', 'CV']:
        structure[folder] = document_folder_structure(os.path.join(base_path, folder))
    return structure

def analyze_latex_cv(cv_path):
    sections = {}
    with open(cv_path, 'r') as file:
        content = file.read()
        # Parse LaTeX sections using regex or LaTeX parser
        # Identify updateable sections
    return sections

def create_content_mapping(obsidian_structure, latex_sections):
    mapping = {}
    # Create logical connections between Obsidian content and CV sections
    return mapping
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify all specified Obsidian paths are accessible and documented
2. Confirm LaTeX CV structure is correctly parsed and sections identified
3. Validate the mapping document covers all relevant CV sections
4. Review with manual inspection to ensure no critical content areas are missed
5. Create test cases that trace sample content from Obsidian to corresponding CV sections
