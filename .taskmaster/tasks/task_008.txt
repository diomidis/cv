# Task ID: 8
# Title: Implement Interview Preparation Integration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 7
# Priority: low
# Description: Develop functionality to connect interview preparation materials with CV content for consistent job application strategy.
# Details:
This task involves:
1. Implement access to interview preparation materials in Obsidian
2. Create connection between CV content and interview talking points
3. Develop consistency checking between CV claims and interview preparation
4. Build interview strategy suggestions based on CV content
5. Implement salary negotiation material integration

Implementation approach:
```python
class InterviewIntegration:
    def __init__(self, obsidian_reader, latex_processor):
        self.obsidian_reader = obsidian_reader
        self.latex_processor = latex_processor
    
    def extract_interview_materials(self):
        # Access interview preparation folder
        interview_path = "Interviews"
        materials = {}
        
        # Get list of interview preparation files
        interview_files = self.obsidian_reader.list_files(interview_path)
        
        for file in interview_files:
            content = self.obsidian_reader.read_file(os.path.join(interview_path, file))
            materials[file] = self.parse_interview_material(content)
        
        return materials
    
    def parse_interview_material(self, content):
        # Extract structured information from interview preparation
        parsed = {
            'talking_points': self.extract_talking_points(content),
            'questions': self.extract_questions(content),
            'salary_info': self.extract_salary_info(content)
        }
        return parsed
    
    def extract_talking_points(self, content):
        # Extract talking points from interview material
        pass
    
    def extract_questions(self, content):
        # Extract practice questions from interview material
        pass
    
    def extract_salary_info(self, content):
        # Extract salary negotiation information
        pass
    
    def check_cv_interview_consistency(self):
        # Get CV content
        cv_content = self.latex_processor.get_all_sections()
        
        # Get interview materials
        interview_materials = self.extract_interview_materials()
        
        # Check for consistency between CV claims and interview talking points
        inconsistencies = []
        for section, content in cv_content.items():
            # Compare with relevant interview talking points
            # Identify potential inconsistencies
            pass
        
        return inconsistencies
    
    def generate_interview_suggestions(self, company_name=None):
        # Generate interview preparation suggestions based on CV content
        # If company_name is provided, tailor to specific company
        pass
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for interview material extraction
2. Test consistency checking with sample CV and interview content
3. Verify suggestion generation with various CV sections
4. Test company-specific tailoring of interview suggestions
5. Validate salary negotiation information extraction
6. Integration tests with actual interview preparation documents
